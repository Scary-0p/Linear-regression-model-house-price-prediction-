Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build a Linear Regression model in Machine Learning to predict house prices. The workflow involves analyzing a real estate dataset to determine how various factors influence housing prices. Key steps include Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), splitting the data into training and testing sets, model building, evaluation, and making predictions.

Problem Statement

A real estate agent seeks assistance in predicting house prices across different regions in the USA. To address this, a dataset of housing sales has been provided. The task is to develop a Linear Regression model that can accurately estimate the selling price of a house based on its features.

Dataset Overview
Format: CSV
Size: 5000 rows × 7 columns
Features:
Avg. Area Income – Average income of householders in the city where the house is located
Avg. Area House Age – Average age of houses in the city
Avg. Area Number of Rooms – Average number of rooms in houses within the city
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms – Average number of bedrooms in houses within the city
Area Population – Population of the city
Price – Sale price of the house (target variable)
Address – Address of the house

This project provides a practical example of applying regression techniques in the real estate domain, helping agents and analysts better estimate property values based on demographic and housing features.
